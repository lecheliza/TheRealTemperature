# TheRealTemperature
Project for 5th semester subject Internet of Things. 

The aim of the project is to create the thermometer showing the current outdoor temperature based on the measurements from two sides of the building - one measurement is taken in the sun, whilst the second - in the shade. Project was realized with the use of Arduino Uno as the main device displaying the temperature and two NodeMCUs as devices measuring it.
